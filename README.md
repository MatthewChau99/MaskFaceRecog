## Repo structure
The python scripts are just for reference about what might be needed for our system to work. <br>

We can first write codes on Colab notebooks perhaps that's more straightforward! <br>
Directly writing codes for each part in its corresponding python file, which I created, is also fine. <br>
If we go for Colab first and if we have time at the latter stage, we could make the entire code more organized by filling in those python scripts. <br>

`main.py`: end-to-end training and evaluation on the datasets using our model <br>
`dataloader.py`: load masked/unmasked face image dataset <br>
`trainer.py`: train the model <br>
`eval.py`: evaluate the model <br>
`iresnet.py`: Backbone networks - Improved ResNet <br>
`model.py`: FocusFace architecture <br>
`metrics.py`: computation of evaluation metrics <br>
